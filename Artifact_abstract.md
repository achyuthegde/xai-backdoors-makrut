This artifact submission comprises both software and data utilized for the evaluation of our paper, where we introduce Makrut, a novel model manipulation attack targeting the model-agnostic, black-box explanation method LIME. The experiments described in Sections 4, 5, and 6 of the paper illustrate the effectiveness of Makrut in manipulating model explanations to produce misleading or deceptive interpretations. This artifact facilitates the replication of all experiments presented in the paper, which are conducted on the Imagenette and COMPAS datasets.
The software component includes the source code and binaries required to replicate all experiments. Key dependencies for executing the code include four NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPUs (or equivalent hardware), a minimum of 64 GB of system RAM, and CUDA 11.8 or higher. The data component provides the pre-trained models and datasets needed to run the experiments. The inclusion of pre-trained models is intended to expedite the verification of experimental results, eliminating the necessity for additional model training.
The artifact is hosted on our GitHub repository, which offers detailed documentation on environment setup, experiment execution, and result interpretation. Additionally, the repository provides scripts to download datasets and pre-trained models.
